			<p class="intro">Hello! I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Dallas who's highly involved with student organizations. You can read more about my acomplishments and career goals on my <a href="https://roman.hn">professional website</a>, and you can contact me at <img class="email" src="./email.svg" alt="roman at U-T Dallas dot E-D-U"/>.</p>

			<h2>Effective Altruism UTD</h2>
			
			<p>If you wanted to have a positive impact on the world, how should you go about it? Conventional advice might lead you to focus on your local community: say, donating to a food bank or volunteering to pick up litter. But if you thought critically about how to do the <em>most</em> good with resources you have, this would lead you to take much different actions.</p>

			<p>This is the focus of <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective altruism</a>: a project that aims to find the best ways to help others, and put them into practice. It's both a research field which aims to identify the world's most pressing problems and the best solutions to them, and a practical community that aims to use those findings to do good.  

			<p>People inspired by effective altruism have worked on projects that range from funding the distribution of 200 million malaria nets, to academic research on the future of AI, to campaigning for policies to prevent the next pandemic.</p>
			<p>I'm co-founding UTD's effective altruism student group, which will give interested students a space to learn about and discuss these ideas, receive career advice, get connected to relevant people and resources, and conduct outreach on campus. To learn more and get involved, <a href="https://discord.gg/AnAmuvVqWm">join our Discord server</a>.</p>

			<h2>ACM Research</h2>

			<p>This semester, I'm the director of ACM Research: a semester-long program to help undergraduate students get involved with Computer Science research. Four teams of six students each are working on projects on topics ranging from cybersecurity analysis to computer vision, and they will present their results  during the ACM Research Symposium on November 28th at 8:30pm CT in the TI Auditorium.</p>

			<h2>Computer Security Group</h2>

			<p>I also help run UTD's <a href="https://csg.utdallas.edu/">Computer Security Group</a>. We give weekly talks on security-related topics and attend monthly meetups with the Dallas Hackers' Association.</p>
