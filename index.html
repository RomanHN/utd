		<h2>OpenUTD</h2>
		<p>I'm an officer for <a href="https://openutd.club/">OpenUTD</a>, a student organization dedicated to free and open-source software. We host coding nights and technology-related talks. Keep an eye out for two talks I will be holding this semester: one about internet privacy and the other about the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ConTeXt">ConTeXt typesetting system</a>.</p>
		<h2>ACM Research</h2>
		<p>I'm also one of six leads for <a href="https://acmutd.co/research">ACM Research</a>: a division of UTD's chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery. This semester, I'm leading four participants through a <a href="https://github.com/ACM-Research/targeted-password-guesses">project</a> about machine learning to generate targeted password guesses.</p>
